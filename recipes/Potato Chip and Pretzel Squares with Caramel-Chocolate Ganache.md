		- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
		- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
		- 1-1/2 sticks (3/8 pound) unsalted butter, melted
	- ### For the Ganache
		- 7 ounces bittersweet dark chocolate roughly chopped (about 1-1/4 cups)
		- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
		- 1 cup granulated sugar
		- 2 tablespoons corn syrup
		- 1 cup room-temperature heavy cream

- ## Directions
	- ### Make the Crust
		- Preheat the oven to 350 degF. Line the baking sheet with parchment paper.

		- Combine the chips, pretzels, sugar, and flour in a food processor and pulse until the mixture has the texture of very coarse bread crumbs, stopping occasionally to stir to make sure the texture is even. Pour in the butter and pulse just until the mixture is evenly moistened. Add the mixture to the baking sheet and press to form an even layer.

		- Bake the crust until it's evenly peanut-butter brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let the crust cool completely.

		- Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and 3 tablespoons water in a medium sauce-pan. Set the pan over medium-high heat and let the mixture get liquidy, about 2 minutes. Cook without stirring but rotating the pan on the stove if some spots turn brown much faster than others, until it turns a mahogany color, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in the cream, bring it to a boil over high heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, until any caramel that hardened has melted back into the mixture, 1 to 2 minutes.

		- Stir in the butter until it melts, then pour the hot mixture into the bowl with the chocolate and stir until the chocolate has completely melted. Immediately pour the chocolate mixture onto the pretzel crust, tilting the baking sheet so the ganache spreads out in an even layer on top of the crust. Sprinkle on the pretzel salt.

		- Let the ganache cool, then cover and chill in the fridge until the ganache is firm and cold. Cut into approximately 3-inch squares and serve right out of the fridge.
